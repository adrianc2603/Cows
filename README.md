# Cows
## By Adrian Currington

### Game Description
Welcome to Cows - the maze adventure that you've been waiting for!

In this adventure, you will guide a cow through a series of mazes, collecting coins along
the way. Gold coins are worth $5, silver coins are worth $3 and bronze coins are worth $1.

Each maze is completed by reaching some grass that the cow can munch on. Your goal is to complete the adventure, collecting as many coins as possible.

But beware, there are blue and red enemies scattered throughout the adventure. Collide with a blue enemy and you will lose $50, going back to level 1 if this takes your wealth to below $0. 5 seconds will also be added on to your time. Collide with a red enemy and you will lose all your wealth, restarting the game at level 1.
